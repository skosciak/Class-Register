About project
    
    In the project, I want to create a virtual class register with students, teachers, and automatic school agenda. 
    The program should check if classrooms don't have too many students, student class is not overpopulated, 
    teachers have time for every class and attend only one class in the set time interval
    in addition app should check if everything is fine and throw messages if, for example, 
    we don't have a teacher for an English lesson even if it's in the school agenda for the class.
